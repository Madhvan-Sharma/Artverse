**Artverse** is a Web application where people can share images. It allows artists from different parts of the world to showcase their talent and it also provides a platform for convenient access of their images.

This web application has been made using ****Desktop**-**first** Responsive Strategy** and has **dark mode** available. 

Users can upload their images and *add it to their private album or keep it public.* This feature allows users to keep their family photos at a cloud storage so that they can be accessed digitally from anywhere in the world. Users can also share their views on different images by *adding comments* on images, *view* different images and much more.
